### Fixes and Improvements

**Tagging**
* Fixed a bug that prevented some tags from being saved correctly due to a double-encoding issue.
* The "Restore deleted tag" functionality has been fixed. This was previously broken after a change to remove tags by ID.
* Tags are now reliably removed by their ID instead of their value, improving data integrity.
* Resolved a UI layering (z-index) issue where the tagging selection menu would incorrectly appear behind modals.

**User Interface (UI)**
* Fixed an issue in modals where users could not type or search in dropdown menus (select2). The dropdowns are now correctly attached to the modal body, re-enabling keyboard events.

**Configuration**
* Cerebrate will now correctly fall back to the `baseurl` defined in `config.json` if the `fullbaseurl` is not set, improving configuration flexibility.


### Maintenance

* The `sqlite3` dependency requirement has been corrected.
