## Cerebrate 1.0 released

We are pleased to announce the [first official release of Cerebrate](https://www.cerebrate-project.org/). Whilst it is still early days for the project, our hope is that the platform in its current state already brings a notable improvement.

## What is Cerebrate?

Cerebrate is a new open source tool, aiming to address several deficiencies in our tool chains, including having a central contact database for communities as well as community interconnection orchestration and security tool fleet management.

This first release of Cerebrate acts as a basis for future developments in the above areas, with functionalities to cover a host of different tasks.

## Main features

- Contact database containing information on organisations and individuals
- Public key store for the above for information validation and secure communications
- Centralised sharing group management
- Cerebrate to Cerebrate synchronisation
- Local integration module system
  - Currently with a [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) module included
- Cerebrate to Cerebrate local tool interconnection
- Local tool fleet management features
- Ingestion tools for community specific contact database mappings
  - currently supporting [ENISA](https://www.enisa.eu/)'s and [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/)'s mappings
- Integration with Keycloak

We welcome any ideas for improvement, pull requests and bug reports from the community. Additionally, we are also looking for tool developers / vendors that would like to work with us on integration modules for their respective tools.
