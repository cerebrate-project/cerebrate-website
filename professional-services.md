Cerebrate Professional Services (CPS) is a program managed by the lead developers of the Cerebrate Project to offer highly skilled services around Cerebrate and to support the sustainability of the Cerebrate ecosystem. This initiative addresses the policy requirements of companies/organizations that need commercial support contracts.

In addition to the best-effort support available through the usual support channels, Cerebrate Professional Services are designed for companies and organizations that need their issues fast-tracked and prioritized.

# Support Contract

We offer an annual support contract for the fast-tracked resolution of 5 issues (6 hours per ticket). This contract includes the prioritized resolution of 5 issues, configuration requests, or fast-tracked bug fixes for the Cerebrate core software or modules maintained by us. Support is provided through our ticket system within business hours. Fast-tracking new/custom features is usually project-based and not included in this support contract, but exceptions can be made based on the complexity of the requested feature. This support contract costs EUR 10.000,00 per year.

# Sustainability Support

To support the sustainability of Cerebrate as an Open Source project, we offer the display of your logo prominently on the Cerebrate Project website's supporter section. This type of support costs EUR 15.000,00 per year.

# Support Contract & Sustainability Support

To further support Cerebrateâ€™s sustainability, we offer a combined package that includes the display of your logo on the Cerebrate Project website's supporter section, along with the prioritized resolution of 6 issues, configuration requests, or fast-tracked bug fixes for the Cerebrate core software or modules maintained by us. Support is provided through our ticket system within business hours. Fast-tracking new/custom features is usually project-based and not included in this support contract, but exceptions can be made depending on the complexity. This combined support package costs EUR 21.500,00 per year.
